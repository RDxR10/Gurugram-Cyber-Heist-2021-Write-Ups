The challenge:
```
This is the last step of the heist and some noobs will say it is difficult but mark my words its all about maths, numbers and a good programmer with a curious mindset.
CFF{POUAAABMEHXKFRSRCLKTG} is the flag. Key to every locker is often not given but if you are still curious https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanjiofficial/   (Points: 150)
Hint: If Aman Sir will ever get a chance, he will marry at Eiffel Tower.
```

* Eiffel Tower -> Vignere Cipher
* Attempts were made to guess the key:
  * Tried with `amanjiofficial` -> no result
  * Eventually, I wrote a script, but it was taking a lot of time (for some reason)
  * Then `amanahuja` was tried, but still there was no clue of the flag.
  * Finally `amanahujaisthecreatoroft` worked, the flag was `CTF{CONGRATULATIONSYOUWON}`
