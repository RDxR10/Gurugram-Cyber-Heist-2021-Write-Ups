```Our server has been taken over by a Hacker and we have appointed you as the cyber security expert to catch the Hacker. 
In our initial investigation we found that the Hacker is very fond of using hashtags and we got a clue about him. 
Follow #hackershalahackershala group to get to the Hacker. One interesting fact about this social media platform is that it can do what even twitter cannot.
```
